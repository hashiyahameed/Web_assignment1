        <p>A <strong>husky</strong> is a sled dog used in the polar regions. One can differentiate huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style.<br> When used as a sled dog, they represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs] (the Alaskan Malamute, by contrast,<br> pulled heavier loads at a slower speed).Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Various companies have marketed tourist treks with<br> dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions. Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes<br> for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.</p>
